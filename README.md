# Rhubarb Garden:

a glorified walking sim for the Acerola Jam 0.

The theme for the jam was aberration so I tried to create a game that switches up half way through.  Another definition of aberration is "wandering off the beaten path" so I was inspired to create a game focused on a confusing path.
